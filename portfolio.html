					<h1 class="portfolio-title">Equilibrium Simulator</h1>
					<p class="portfolio-description">An interactive demonstration that models equilibrium in chemical reactions. The reaction is modeled as bouncing particles which can move between opposing sides of the reaction. From the control panel, the user can modify the concentration, temperature, and required energy to observe how each can affect the equilibrium of the reaction. This program can be used as an educational tool for teaching equilibrium reactions in chemistry.</p>
